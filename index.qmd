### Welcome to my site!

I'm a Professor in the [Department of Urban and Regional Planning](https://urban.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I teach and research at the intersection of housing policy, neighborhood change, and social equity in cities. In the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, I serve as the Director of Graduate Studies.

At University of Illinois, I run the [Illinois Housing Lab](https://housinglab.agreen4.web.illinois.edu), and am a faculty affiliate of the [Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://csbs.research.illinois.edu) the [Institute of Government and Public Affairs](https://igpa.uillinois.edu/andrew-greenlee/), the [Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies](https://lemann.illinois.edu), and the [Center for Latin American & Caribbean Studies](https://clacs.illinois.edu).

I will not be accepting applications from prospective Ph.D. advisees in the 2024-2025 admission cycle.
