I remember how overwhelming it was navigate a move to Champaign in 2011. Over the years, I've amassed some resources that I often share with incoming faculty, visiting scholars, and students to help ease that transition.

The usual caveats apply, however - your mileage may vary, and these are a selection of personal recommendations. Mentions or links to certain businesses do not equal an endorsement.

## Housing

It's hard to encapsulate housing since this is such a personal process. I rented a house for several years before buying. I know plenty of new faculty who purchased a house when they moved to the area. While large landlords dominate the student housing market, for individuals who are looking for non-student housing, you are likely to have more luck with smaller landlords.

For incoming faculty, if you're able to come to town, I think that will help greatly with identifying neighborhoods and housing options that make sense for you. At a minimum, have someone here go check things out for you before you commit!

I've had a good experience with [State Farm / John Caywood](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/us/il/champaign/john-caywood-1dbh14npnal) for insurance - they've always been responsive and easy to work with.

## Schools

On schools, Champaign and Urbana are in separate school districts.

-   **Urbana:** [Urbana School District 116](https://usd116.org) uses a neighborhood schools model (so attendance areas determine school choice). Arguably the most popular school particularly for faculty kids is Leal elementary (and therefore lots of faculty live in the area around the school, which is also relatively convenient to campus.

-   **Champaign:** [Champaign Unit 4 School District](https://www.champaignschools.org) uses a school lottery system. This means that you have the opportunity to state a rank order preference from among all the schools in the city (and also receive some extra preference for the schools closest to your house), and then the school district uses this information to assign your school.

-   We've had a great experience with [Countryside School](https://www.countrysideschool.org/quicklinks) which is a private independent school focused on grades K-8.

## Groceries

There's multiple Schnucks, Meijer, etc. for everyday stuff. We use Aldi to buy our basic weekly items and then supplement with items from other stores as needed. For bulk purchasing, there's a [Costco](https://www.costco.com/warehouse-locations/champaign-il-1384.html) and [Sam's club](https://www.samsclub.com/club/champaign-il-sams-club/8197). Lots of other ethnic and specialty grocery places -- these are just the ones I tend to go to more frequently.

-   [Cheese and Crackers](http://www.crackerscheese.com) has a great cheese and deli selection. They also are the best option for high-quality fresh fish which is driven down from fish distributors in Chicago several times a week. They have an email list for what fish is in season. You order the day before and your fish is ready for pick up the next day.

-   [Art Mart](https://www.shopartmart.com) also has a great cheese and deli selection, quality wine (Todd can get you almost anything and is a pleasure to do business with), and they also have a great selection of higher-end kids toys, games, and books.

-   [Common Ground Food Co-Op](https://www.commonground.coop) is our local co-op option -- lots of local and specialty food. Its certainly a scene for us university types. Cooking classes, good curated wine selection, and [Chamanoy Knife Sharpening](https://www.facebook.com/champaignurbanaknifesharpening/) on some Saturdays.

-   [World Harvest Foods / Strawberry Fields Cafe](https://worldharvestfoods.com/strawberry-fields/) in Urbana has a good selection of international foods (far more specialized than what you can get in the grocery store).

-   [Fresh International Market](https://freshimarket.com) has a pretty good selection of Asian groceries, and a decent fresh section. I don't go here a lot, but do stock up on mushrooms, greens, rice, noodles, miso, etc. here.

-   [Bane Family Meats](https://www.banefamilymeats.com) -- local veterinarian turned small farmer who raises meat. He does home deliveries.

-   [Triple S Farms](https://www.triplesfarms.com) -- another good local meat purveyor - available through their website, at the Urbana farmer's market, and in other retail locations like the Coop.

-   [Old Time Meat and Deli](https://oldtimemeatanddeli.com) is a great butcher. They can also special order cuts or items for you.

-   [UIUC Meat Lab](https://meatandeggsales.illinois.edu) sells meat that has been produced on campus or through campus operations. Much of the butchery and retail is done by students, which is an bonus part of the meat lab experience.

-   [Prairie Fruits Farm](https://www.prairiefruits.com) has local goat cheese, goats milk gelato, and other specialty items. They have hours where you can go visit the goats which makes a great family trip. They also do [dinners](https://www.prairiefruits.com/calendar-and-tickets) that bring down chefs from Chicago, Saint Louis, and other regional markets to cook with local produce.

## Slightly Longer Trips

### Chicago

Chicago recommendations really need their own page. Here's a few selections though.

#### To Do

Consider visiting the [Chicago History Museum](), the [Chicago Architecture Center](), or the [DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center](https://www.dusablemuseum.org). The [National Museum of Mexican Art](https://nationalmuseumofmexicanart.org) is also excellent.

#### Food

Chicago is a food city – you can learn a lot by visiting a range of eating establishments

-   [Jim’s Original](http://jimsoriginal.com): Polish Sausage

-   [Al’s #1 Italian Beef](https://www.alsbeef.com/chicago-little-italy-taylor-street): My preference is dipped with hot peppers.

-   [Bari Italian Foods](https://www.bariitaliansubs.com) - You want the Italian Sandwich from the deli in the back

-   [Girl and the Goat](https://www.girlandthegoat.com/chicago) or [Little Goat Diner](https://www.littlegoatchicago.com)

-   Jibarito Sandwich – a Chicago invention of the Puerto Rican community – in fact, Paseo Boricua would be a good neighborhood to visit too.

-   [Taqueria La Pasadita](http://www.pasadita.com) (Wicker Park) or [La Casa Del Pueblo](https://www.facebook.com/LACASADELPUEBLORESTAURANT/) (Pilsen)

-   [Yvolina's Tamales](https://www.facebook.com/yvolinastamales/): Wrapped in banana leaves. So good.

-   Devon Avenue is where to go for Indian food

### Saint Louis

-   [The City Museum](https://www.citymuseum.org): This place is wild, and while it's clearly intended for kids, there's a lot for adults to enjoy too.

-   [Salt + Smoke Barbecue](https://www.saltandsmokebbq.com): Somehow we found ourselves here on a night in December where the temperature was in the 70s. Pretty much everything we had was delicious. I wish we had been able to try the desserts, but our unseasonably warm evening turned into a scene from a disaster movie as severe weather ripped through the region. Very much worth a visit.

-   [Pappy's Smokehouse](https://www.pappyssmokehouse.com): Also excellent barbecue - I don't have a weather story about this place...

-   [The Fountain on Locust](https://www.fountainonlocust.com): Very beautiful ice cream parlor and bar with an excellent food menu too.

-   [Comet Coffee](http://cometcoffeestl.com): Their bakery produces one of the finest croissants I've ever had - many thanks to [Dr. Meaghan Kirkwood](https://www.meghankirkwood.com/about) for introducing this place.

### Louisville

-   [Muhammad Ali Center](https://alicenter.org)

-   [Kentucky Peerless Distilling Co.](https://kentuckypeerless.com)
